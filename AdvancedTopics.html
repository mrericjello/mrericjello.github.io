                   <p>The world has become increasingly dependent on the World Wide Web in financial, economic, public, and private institutions. Which means sensitive information such as bank accounts, corporate documents, and social security are at risk from being stolen. File Transfer Protocol was one of the very first ways to transfer information. However, anyone could grab a hold of it if they new where the protocol was being sent to a certain port on a server. Also, if we didn't have accounts protected, anyone could access information on their own browser.</p>
                    <p>To rememdy this Security Layers have been added to a variety of all Protocols from Application to File Transfer. If you see an "s" at the end of a protocol such as HTTPS, it means it has a security layer added to it. That is why on HTTPS web pages, you will see a pad lock appear in your browser address bar. Even encrypting files, and then encrypting the protocols themselves will add security.</p>
                    <p>"Better safe than sorry." Every web developer should be aware of different security types. If you're developing a site that requires authentification, or any information that is required on the part of the client, then you should always be ready to add security layers. This will increase user confidence in the security of your website, and in the end protect both you and the user.</p>

                <p>Ever see a button on your browser that says "Browse Anonymously" with a mask next to it? You may be thinking, "Why? I don't have anything to hide." While this may be true, it is not always a matter of hiding things, but a matter of privacy. Every browser and website collects data on you're browsing history, cookies, and any relevant data. Ever see an advertisement that has your name? How did they know you're name? Simply put, they collected your data and placed it into their algorithms to send you advertisements for things that you'd most likely buy.</p>
            <p>"But that's a huge invasion of my privacy!" Sound familiar? You're not alone. This is why anonymity has become a pressing issue in the contemporary world of the web. Browsing anonymously is an option to protect your information. Whether by your own browser options, proxy servers, or the Dark Web, browsing anonymously is an option that is slowly becoming the norm. </p>
                <p>But it's no guarantee. Many of the technologies that give anonymity have actually been developed by authority agencies and military operations. Analysts can still analyze traffic patterns and pin-point certain users. The point of this all is simply to give users of the web freedom to browse without fear being under scrutiny from data-mining companies or hackers.</p>

                <p>The Dark Web is essentially the e-Black Market of the world. It provides anonymity through the Tor browser. This anonymous browser was developed by U.S. Naval Intelligence. You can essentially buy anything at Dark websites such as the silk road which was taken down but we all know that there are back ups and alternative markets. Consumercentric attitude is how vendors in the Dark Web keep their supply coming is because quality and pleasing the customer is number one. This is achieved in an interesting way (studied by economists) because black markets do not undergo regulation. There are guidelines that may be bent or broken. Bitcoin the cryptocurrency is exchanged for goods through a third party that is encrypted. Microlaundering systems allow for perfect anonymity. What is interesting to me is Bitcoin and how it works. The cyber world has essentially allowed for us to create privacy locks and now majority of users are calling for more privacy from hackers, government and even our own jobs. It seems there are two polarizing web systems, one that calls for complete privacy and anonymity vs. one that calls for complete public access and social networking. </p>

                <p>After the finished product is produced by the developers, a very important part of the development of a solution is Development and Optimization.

                <p>As a developer, you are presented with a problem by a client. For example, a client would like an app for their small business to fulfill online orders. After you determined a plan to create a solution, you go to work developing a prototype. A prototype is sample or early model of the app you wish to create. Why not just develop the app fullly? No developer can foresee any problems that might come with their app. So to give the client an idea of what the solution may look like when completed, we make prototypes. It's a great way to have the client's feedback on how they like the app and is a starting place for further development.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>Testing is a crucial part of web development. After loading your prototype to the server, you begin testing by allowing users to use your prototype. You can collect data on your site in a number of ways. A great free solution to gather data on your site is Google Analytics. It collects data on user traffic flow, how many people visit the site everyday, etc. This is crucial as you can tell which pages get the most traffic, and whether or not your site is even being used or searched for.</p>
                <p>But what if you already have a site and simply would like to test a beta version of a new site? This is known as A/B(Alpha/Beta) Testing. An alpha site is your original site that is being used by the average everyday user. The beta site is the new version that you are testing on random users of your site. Combined with some form of data analytics, the developer can tell differences between the alpha and beta sites. Usually the beta is implemented into becoming the new alpha site if it proves more successful and user friendly. However, sometimes beta development projects are killed if they are not well received by users. Back to the drawing board!</p>

                </h3>
                <p>Optimizing can have a broad meaning when it comes to web development. Usually it refers to Search Engine Optimization. There are two ways to find a website or app: if you already know the url, or the more popular way is to search for it. But how do search engines like Google or Bing know to find the site you're looking for? Web developers optimize their pages by adding in specific code and content that prompt engines to find them. As a web developer, it is important to know your "site score". Google has made a site to score how well search engines can find your site. This is invaluable as your site most of the time will be searched for rather than typed in to the address bar.</p>

                    <p>The best part of DevOps is that it becomes a continual cycle. After prototyping, testing, and optimization occurs the solution created by you the developer gets re-made with all of your findings. After you've made the new prototype, you send it off to testing again. So is there really a final product? The answer really depends. Web Technologies is a growing and ever changing field so really your solution could be continually DevOpted forever. DevOpception? It's always up to what the user wants and whether you as a developer continue to develop your project or work on new ones. This is the core of how new technologies are made and eventually help us understand what works and what doesn't.</p>
